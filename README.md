# animate-anyone-reproduction
reproduction of AnimateAnyone using SVD

**we will release V1 checkpoint and inference code after spring festival with postprocess to enhance face quality. We will continue tuning the model and update model.**

### To Do list
- [x] piepline based on SVD
- [x] train V0.9 which can only generate 14 frames per ref-image
- [x] train animate-anyone like pipeline V1 which can generate arbitrary frames per ref-image
- [x] enhance face quality and time consistency(trick according to analyse animate anyone app cases)
- [ ] release V1 inference code and model
 ---
 **2024-01-25 update**
- according to analyse animate anyone app cases, we find there may be some tricks instead of training model. so we will update the case which has better face quality with free training.
- the face enhance result shows below in the V1 part
